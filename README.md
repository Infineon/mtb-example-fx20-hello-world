# EZ-USB&trade; FX20: Hello world

This code example demonstrates simple USBFS communication by printing a "Hello world" message on a terminal and toggles GPIO using FX20 devices.

> **Note:** This code example is an alpha release for the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device, and is also applicable to EZ-USB&trade; FX10/EZ-USB&trade; FX5 devices

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-fx20-hello-world](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-fx20-hello-world)" application with the desired name "HelloWorld" configured for the *KIT_FX20_FMC_001* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_FX20_FMC_001 --app-id mtb-example-fx20-hello-world --user-app-name FX20_Hello_world --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>


### Open the project

After the project has been created, you can open it in your preferred development environment.


<details><summary><b>Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

If you opened the Project Creator tool from the included Eclipse IDE, the project will open in Eclipse automatically.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Visual Studio (VS) Code</b></summary>

Launch VS Code manually, and then open the generated *{project-name}.code-workspace* file located in the project directory.

For more details, see the [Visual Studio Code for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBVSCodeUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_vscode_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>



<details><summary><b>Command line</b></summary>

If you prefer to use the CLI, open the appropriate terminal, and navigate to the project directory. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program; on Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. From there, you can run various `make` commands.

For more details, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


## Operation

1. Connect the board (J2) to your PC using the provided USB cable. Connect the USBFS port (J3) on the board to PC for debug logs.

2. Open a terminal program and select the Serial COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 921600 baud.

3. Perform the following steps to program the board using the **EZ-USB™ FX Control Center** (Alpha) application.

      1. Open the **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center** application. <br>
      The EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device displays as **EZ-USB&trade; FX Bootloader**.

      2. Select the **FX Bootloader** device in **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center**.
      
      3. Click **Program** > **Internal Flash**.

      4. Navigate to the **\<CE Title>/build/APP_KIT_FX20_FMC_001/Release** folder within the CE directory and locate the *.hex* file and program.

      5. Confirm if the programming is successful in the log window of the **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center** application.
   
4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "\<CE Title>" is displayed on the serial terminal.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/terminal-fx20-hello-world.png)

5. Confirm that GPIO P0_0 & P0_1 toggles at approximately 1 Hz.


## Logging configurations

By default, the USBFS port is enabled for debug logs.
To enable debug logs on UART, set **USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE** compiler flag to '0u' in the *makefile*. SCB1 of the FX20 device is used as UART with a baud rate of 921,600 to send out log messages through the P8.1 pin.


## Debugging

Debug the code example by setting debug levels for the UART logs. Set the **DEBUG_LEVEL** macro in *main.c* file with the following values for debugging.

**Table 1. Debug values**

Macro value     |    Description
:-------------  | :------------
1u              | Enable error messages
2u              | Enable warning messages
3u              | Enable info messages
4u              | Enable all messages

<br>


## Compile-time configurations

This application's functionality can be customized through the compile-time parameters that can be turned ON or OFF through the *makefile*.
The application uses the GNU Arm&reg; 11.3 toolchain, which is part of the ModusToolbox&trade; installation for compilation.
- Run the `make` command or build the project in your IDE to compile the application and generate a USB bootloader compatible binary. This binary can be programmed to the FX20 device using the EZ-USB&trade; Control Center application.
- Run the `make BLENABLE=no` command or set the variable in the **makefile** to compile the application and generate the standalone binary. This binary can be programmed onto the FX20 device through the SWD interface using the OpenOCD tool.
For more details, see the [EZ-USB™ FX20 SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/fx20).

**Table 2. Macro description**

Macro name        |    Description                            | Allowed values
:-------------    | :------------                             | :--------------
USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE | Enable debug logs through USBFS port      | 1u for debug logs over USBFS. <br> 0u for debug logs over UART (SCB1).
