</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-fx20-hello-world](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-fx20-hello-world)" application with the desired name "HelloWorld" configured for the *KIT_FX20_FMC_001* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_FX20_FMC_001 --app-id mtb-example-fx20-hello-world --user-app-name FX20_Hello_world --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Debugging


### Using Arm&reg; debug port

If you have access to a MiniProg or KitProg3 device, you can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

</details>


### Log messages

The code example and the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 stack output debug log messages indicates any unexpected conditions and highlights the operations performed.

By default, the USB FS port is enabled for debug logs. To enable debug logs on UART, set the `USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE` compiler flag to '0u' in the *Makefile*. SCB1 of the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device is used as UART with a baud rate of 921600 to send out log messages through the P8.1 pin.

The verbosity of the debug log output can be modified by setting the `DEBUG_LEVEL` macro in *main.c* file with the values shown in **Table 1**.

**Table 1. Debug values**

Macro value | Description
:-------- | :------------
1u | Enable only error messages
2u | Enable error and warning messages
3u | Enable info messages
4u | Enable all message types

<br>


## Compile-time configurations

Application functionality can be customized by setting variables in *Makefile* or by configuring them through `make` CLI arguments.

- Run the `make build` command or build the project in your IDE to compile the application and generate a USB bootloader-compatible binary. This binary can be programmed onto the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device using the EZ-USB&trade; Control Center application

- Run the `make build BLENABLE=no` command or set the variable in *Makefile* to compile the application and generate the standalone binary. This binary can be programmed onto the EZ-USB&trade; FX20 device through the SWD interface using the OpenOCD tool. For more details, see the [EZ-USB&trade; FX20 SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/fx20)

- Run the `make build CORE=CM0P` command or set the variable in *Makefile* to compile and generate the binary for the Cortex&reg; M0+ core. By default, `CORE` is set as `CM4` and the binary is compiled and generated for the Cortex&reg; M4 core

- Choose between the **Arm&reg; Compiler** or the **GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler** build toolchains by setting the `TOOLCHAIN` variable in *Makefile* to `ARM` or `GCC_ARM` respectively. If you set it to `ARM`, ensure to set `CY_ARM_COMPILER_DIR` as a make variable or environment variable, pointing to the path of the compiler's root directory

Additional settings can be configured through macros specified by the `DEFINES` variable in *Makefile*:

**Table 2. Macro description**

Macro name | Description   | Allowed values
:--------  | :------------ | :-------------
*USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE* | Enable debug logs through USBFS debug port | '1u' to select debug logs over USBFS port <br> '0u' to select debug logs over UART (SCB1)
